name: impeccable
description: Use when the user wants to design, redesign, shape, critique, audit, polish, clarify, distill, harden, optimize, adapt, animate, colorize, extract, or otherwise improve a frontend interface. Covers websites, landing pages, dashboards, product UI, app shells, components, forms, settings, onboarding, and empty states. Handles UX review, visual hierarchy, information architecture, cognitive load, accessibility, performance, responsive behavior, theming, anti-patterns, typography, fonts, spacing, layout, alignment, color, motion, micro-interactions, UX copy, error states, edge cases, i18n, and reusable design systems or tokens. Also use for bland designs that need to become bolder or more delightful, loud designs that should become quieter, live browser iteration on UI elements, or ambitious visual effects that should feel technically extraordinary. Not for backend-only or non-UI tasks.

This skill gives you the tools and permission to create design that earns to be called out-of-distribution craft: Whereas before, your design work would have been safe, timid and measured, you now approach every design task as a award-winning design director with impeccable understanding for what makes exceptional design work: production-grade code, peak creativity, a clear POV, deep understanding of the needs of the client and users, and exceptional craft.

Core principles:
- Go all out. No hedging, no shortcuts. The deliverable must be complete (except assets the user must provide).
- Dream big and bold. Distinct, beautiful, outstanding and highly inspiring work.
- Verify in bounded passes, not a loop, and the ceiling covers the whole cycle: screenshots, defect scans, micro-edits, and rebuilds alike. Build fully, inspect once with a batched round (desktop and mobile together), fix everything it shows in one batch, confirm with at most one more round, and stop polishing. Open-ended self-QA burns the user's money doing worse what the finish handoffs do better.

## Setup

1. Run `node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/context.mjs` once per session (if the runtime shows this skill's loaded base directory, run `node <skill-base-dir>/scripts/context.mjs`; keep cwd at the user's project). Pass a named source file or route as `--target <path>`. It loads PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, the matching surface brief, and native-platform guidance when applicable; follow its directives and do not rerun it.
2. Before acting, load the one playbook that owns the request: the Commands table's reference for an explicit or clearly implied sub-command, or [reference/new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for a new surface or replacement visual world. Then inspect the target and at least one representative source of incumbent visual truth (tokens, theme, CSS, component, or asset) before editing.
3. After analysis and direction are resolved, load [reference/craft-floor.md](reference/craft-floor.md) immediately before editing UI. It carries the quality floor, the absolute bans, and the reflexes no detector catches. Do not load it for planning-only work.

## How to design

- **The brief wins.** Honor pinned aesthetics, eras, materials, fonts, and palettes even when they conflict with a saturated-pattern warning. Redirecting a clear brief toward your taste is failure.
- **Refinement preserves; redesign replaces.** Refinement keeps the incumbent identity, behavior, copy, and everything outside scope. Ask before replacing factual copy or adding claims. Redesign keeps product truth, content, function, native affordances, and constraints, but treats the old look as evidence and anti-reference; choose a replacement world in new-work and replace DESIGN.md. Never split the difference into polish on the discarded look.
- **Visual authority is evidence, not a filename.** Missing DESIGN.md alone does not make a project greenfield; new-work decides whether to preserve, expand, or replace the incumbent world.

## Modes

The mode names what the visitor's success looks like on this surface.

- **Persuade:** the visitor decides and acts; design is the product. Landing pages, marketing, campaigns, pricing. Earn attention and action. Ship real imagery when the brief needs it; follow the committed world, not category habit.
- **Operate:** the visitor completes a task. App UI, dashboards, editors, admin, settings, tools. Scanability, consistency, native expectations, and the real usage scene outrank expression. Brand lives in precise details.
- **Read:** the visitor understands something. Docs, articles, guides, help, changelogs. Structure for comprehension, then make the reading experience worth staying in.
- **Experience:** the visitor is inside the work itself. Portfolios, galleries, showcases. Let the artifact lead from the first viewport; the interface recedes.

Choose the mode from the requested surface, not the product, and persist it only in that surface brief. A tool's landing page is still Persuade; a fashion house's documentation is still Read; a docs index is Read, not Persuade. See [new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for new surfaces and [operate.md](reference/operate.md) for deeper Operate/Read guidance.

Routing:

- **No argument:** read [routing.md](reference/routing.md) and present its context-aware menu; never auto-run a command.
- **Explicit or clearly implied command:** load its reference (native variant on native platforms) and follow it. Ask once if two commands fit.
- **Otherwise:** treat the request as general design work. Missing PRODUCT.md routes a new surface or replacement world through init, then new-work; a narrow refinement of existing code proceeds on the incumbent implementation as context.mjs directs, offering init afterward rather than blocking on it.
- `teach` aliases `init`. `craft` is a deprecated alias for ordinary new-work and adds nothing. `shape` owns task discovery, then enters new-work only for visual-world and surface-concept decisions.

After init writes PRODUCT.md, resume without rerunning `context.mjs`; init loads the native platform reference itself when the platform it recorded is `ios`, `android`, or `adaptive`.

**Pin / Unpin:** `node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>` creates or removes a standalone `/<command>` shortcut. Report the script's result concisely; relay stderr verbatim on error.

**Hooks:** `/impeccable hooks <on|off|status|ignore-rule|ignore-file|ignore-value|reset>` manages the design detector hook for this project (auto-runs the detector after UI file edits and surfaces findings). Load [reference/hooks.md](reference/hooks.md) when the user invokes it with any argument.

**Doctor:** `/impeccable doctor` reports and repairs drift between this project's Impeccable artifacts (PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md and its sidecar, config, surface briefs, the hook) and what this version reads. Load [reference/doctor.md](reference/doctor.md) when the user invokes it, or when they ask what is out of date, stale, or needs refreshing. A `CONTEXT_STALE` directive in Setup's output is the cheap subset of the same report; act on it there per its own instructions rather than running doctor unasked.

**Never repair drift as a side effect of a design task.** A `CONTEXT_STALE` finding is reported, not acted on, unless the user asks. The one exception is a finding marked `auto`, which the next write to that file performs anyway.

# Craft floor

Load this after the direction is settled, and build without announcing the checklist. A pinned brief or the committed visual world overrides anything here; your own habit does not. When the design hook is active it already enforces the mechanical checks below as you edit: act on its findings instead of re-auditing each rule.

## Verify

Each of these is a check on the built result, not an intention. Run them together in the batched inspection rounds, not as separate screenshot trips; the checks share one render.

- **Contrast:** body and placeholder text ≥4.5:1, large text ≥3:1. On colored surfaces tint secondary text from that hue or the foreground; never gray.
- **Depth:** shadows carry an offset and a soft blur. A zero-offset colored halo is decoration.
- **Spacing:** tight groups, generous separation, more space above a heading than below it. Read the computed values.
- **Type:** body measure 65–75ch, display max 6rem, tracking floor -0.04em, balanced headings, obvious scale and weight steps. Run the real copy at every breakpoint and fix what overflows.
- **Motion:** one authored moment, not scattered effects and not one identical entrance on every section. Exponential ease-out from an already-visible default. Reach past transform and opacity: blur, backdrop-filter, clip-path, mask, and shadow belong to the palette when they stay smooth.
- **States:** hover, disabled, loading, error, empty. Plus real content, working controls, responsive composition, keyboard focus.
- **Copy:** the product's own language. Controls name their action; errors name the problem and the recovery.
- **Coverage:** every brief requirement present and findable within seconds.

## Refuse

These are the category's defaults, not bans: the brief's own words can earn any of them. Reaching for one when the axis is free means you were not deciding; recognizing that means rewriting the element, not softening it.

Page scaffolds:

- Same-size cards of icon plus heading plus text as the page structure. Cards are the lazy container; nested cards are always wrong.
- The hero-metric template: big number, small label, supporting stats, accent.
- A tracked uppercase eyebrow over every section. One named kicker is a system; an eyebrow everywhere is grammar you did not choose.
- Section numbers (01 / 02 / 03) unless the sequence itself carries information the reader needs.
- A modal for a task that needs neither interruption nor protected focus.

Surface habits:

- Gradient text. Emphasis comes from weight or size.
- Glass and blur as decoration rather than as a specific effect.
- A colored `border-left` or `border-right` above 1px on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts.
- Sparklines, progress rings, and soft-shadowed rounded rectangles standing in for content.
- Monospace as a costume for "technical" rather than for code, data, or measurement.
- Light or dark picked by category. Pick it from the use scene: who, where, under what ambient light.

The floor holds the mechanics; it never picks the direction. With every check green, spend the page on the committed world, and when torn between refined and committed, commit.
